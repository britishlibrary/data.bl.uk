Since 2004, the [UK Web Archive](http://www.webarchive.org.uk/) has been collecting websites by permission. As seeking appropriate permissions is time-consuming, this naturally means that the collection is much smaller than some of our other collections. However, the selective nature of the collection means that the sites are generally of high quality, and the archival copies have manually quality-checked and carefully annotated.
